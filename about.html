## About

<small>Hi there! Welcome to my webpage. I am a grad student at Arizona State University currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. I am currently a part of the Impact Lab at Arizona State University. I have worked as a Graduate Assisstant for both Graduate and Undergraduate level courses. My current research interests involve using Deep Learning to solve real-time problems involving recognition of gestures and human computer interaction.</small>

Recent Activity:<br>
<small>
Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.<br>
CVPR 2017 Intel Student Ambassador Forum: July 2017, Honolulu, Hawaii.<br>
I presented my work on transforming limited available feature space of sensor data into videos and using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to perform improved classification of gestures. </small>
