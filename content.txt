ACADEMIC PROJECTS:

Graph Database: Java

INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION,
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON THE YELP DATASET MARCH 2017
SKILLS USED: HADOOP, APACHE HIVE, PYTHON
• Developed a system which parses the reviews of various businesses from
the Yelp Dataset and classifies as positive, negative and neutral.
• Data was imported to Hive and MapReduce query operations were
performed to classify data based on a tagged word polarity dictionary.

 American Sign Language Recognition using Kinect and Myo sensors. A system which can recognize various ASL signs and translate them to gloss. Gloss generated is corrected by a language model built on an already existing ASL corpus.

 Context Aware Android Personal Assistant, developed a smart alarm which identifies disturbed sleep episodes based on user movements during sleep and proximity alert when the user enters within a particular radius of a location.

 Music Recommender System. Developed a web application predicts what songs will be suitable for a singer as per his Voice Profile. Prediction done using Naïve Bayes using Java. Gives the singer a list of songs suitable.
 Designed of a “Lexical analyser” to parse a C++ program from any given program as a part of System Software course using C++. The program separates all words in the input program and classifies it into various tokens.

 “ChatBot for Android”, developed a chatbot using PandoraBots AIML files with a GUI similar to a normal messaging application which allows the user to interact with the ChatBot. Data for chat is trained and stored in the AIML files.
